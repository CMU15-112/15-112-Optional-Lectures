From the help page: 

A data frame with 4601 observations and 58 variables.

The first 48 variables contain the frequency of the variable name (e.g., business) in the e-mail. If the variable name starts with num (e.g., num650) the it indicates the frequency of the corresponding number (e.g., 650). The variables 49-54 indicate the frequency of the characters ‘;’, ‘(’, ‘[’, ‘!’, ‘\$’, and ‘\#’. The variables 55-57 contain the average, longest and total run-length of capital letters. Variable 58 indicates the type of the mail and is either "nonspam" or "spam", i.e. unsolicited commercial e-mail.
